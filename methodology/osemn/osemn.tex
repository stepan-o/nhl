    \begin{abstract}

    In a 2010 post Hilary Mason and Chris Wiggins described the OSEMN process as a taxonomy of tasks that a data scientist should feel comfortable working on.

    The title of the post was \textit{A Taxonomy of Data Science} on the now defunct dataists blog\cite{Mason2010}.
    This process has also been used as the structure of a recent book, specifically \textit{Data Science at the Command Line: Facing the Future with Time-Tested Tools} by Jeroen Janssens published by O\â€™Reilly\cite{Janssens}.

    In this document, we take a closer look at the OSEMN process for working through a data problem.
